## Why do products need a vision?

  - 1. **Product Strategy**: The product vision sets the overarching goal and direction for the product. It informs the product strategy by defining the market opportunity, target audience, value proposition, and competitive differentiation. The product strategy is essentially the plan for achieving the vision, outlining how the product will fulfill customer needs and business objectives in the long term.

   - 2. **Product Roadmap**: The product roadmap translates the product vision and strategy into a high-level plan of action. It outlines the key initiatives, features, and milestones that will be implemented over time to realize the vision. The roadmap helps communicate the strategic direction of the product to stakeholders and provides a framework for prioritizing and sequencing initiatives based on their alignment with the vision and strategic goals.

   - 3. **Product Backlog**: The product backlog is a dynamic list of tasks, user stories, and features that need to be developed to deliver value to customers and achieve the product vision. It is informed by the product strategy and roadmap, with items prioritized based on their contribution to the overall vision and strategic objectives. The backlog serves as a tool for organizing, refining, and managing the work required to execute the product strategy and bring the vision to life.

   - 4. **Execution/Delivery**: Execution and delivery refer to the process of actually building and launching the product. This involves implementing the features and initiatives outlined in the product roadmap and backlog, as well as iterating based on user feedback and market dynamics. The product vision serves as a guiding light throughout the execution phase, ensuring that the team remains focused on the ultimate goal and stays aligned with the strategic direction of the product.
