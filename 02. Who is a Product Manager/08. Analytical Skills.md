## Analytical Skills

  - As you carry out your strategy and plan, you need to measure your progress.

  - You will have plenty of product usage data to work with. But numbers only give you a partial picture.

  - With great analytical skills, you can find patterns and dig into the "why" behind the metrics.


## What do we mean by Analytics?

  - Put simply, analytics measure the state of the product, what users are doing, what they are clicking on, etc.

  - These measurements tell us what is going on with the product, although not necessarily why this going on. A measurement by itself tells you very little and is not analytics.

  - It is only when a series of measurements are collected together that they become analytics.


## Why are analytics important?

  - Analytics skills are important for one major reason: What you don't measure, you can't improve.

  - Without knowing what the state of the system is, it is very hard, if not impossible, to do much to change or affect the system.

  - Without ability to capture data and analyze, it is down to random chance whether your product will succeed or fail.
