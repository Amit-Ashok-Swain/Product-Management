## Common structures of product organization
  
  - Different organizations organize their product team differently. There is no one-size-fits-all structure.


## By Product Line

  - Organizing around a product or product line is the most common structure for product teams, especially at larger organizations.

  - Each product has a dedicated product manager who reports directly to the VP of the product or chief product officer.

## By Feature

  - Organizations with complex products may have teams dedicated to particular product functions or features.

  - In this structure, product managers have a discrete area of focus and need visibility into cross-dependencies that exist for the suite of products. A chief product officer helps maintain visibility to create a cohesive whole.
