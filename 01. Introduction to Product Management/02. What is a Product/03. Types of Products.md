### Products can be grouped according to different categories: by customer type, purchasing behaviour, and industry.

#### **A. By Customer Type**

#### There are two major customer types: 

- **Consumer**:

   - **Retail Customers:** These customers buy products directly from manufacturers or retail stores. They often have a wide range of choices and can try before they buy.
   - **Consumers (End Users)**: They buy products for personal use and do not need technical support or specialized knowledge. Examples include mobile phones, laptops.

- **Business:**  This includes both businesses and organizations that use software or hardware for profit, such as manufacturers.
  

  **1. B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Products:**
   - **Definition:** B2C products are goods or services sold directly to individual end-users, catering to the needs, preferences, and consumption patterns of individual consumers. Examples are Facebook, WhatsApp, PayTm, etc.

   - **Examples:** 
     - Electronics: Smartphones (e.g., iPhone, Samsung Galaxy), laptops (e.g., MacBook, Dell XPS).
     - Personal Care Products: Shampoo (e.g., Pantene, Dove), toothpaste (e.g., Colgate, Crest).
     - Clothing: Apparel from various brands (e.g., Nike, Zara), including shirts, pants, and shoes.
     - Household Items: Kitchen appliances (e.g., KitchenAid mixer), furniture (e.g., IKEA sofa).

   **2. B2B (Business-to-Business) Products:**
   - **Definition:** B2B products are intended for sale from one business to another. They are often used in the production of other goods, for operational purposes, or for resale. Examples are Workspace for Facebook, PayTm for Business, Razorpay, etc.

   - **Examples:** 
     - Raw Materials: Steel for construction or manufacturing processes, chemicals for industrial use.
     - Office Supplies: Paper, pens, printers, and other supplies used in office settings.
     - Industrial Machinery: Heavy equipment like manufacturing machines, construction equipment.

    **3. B2B2C (Business-to-Business-to-Consumer) Products:**

   - **Examples:** 
     - Software Solutions: B2B companies providing software solutions to retailers who, in turn, offer these solutions to end consumers.
     - Wholesale Distribution: Manufacturers selling products in bulk to retailers who then sell to individual customers.
     - Marketing Services: Agencies providing marketing services to businesses, and these businesses, in turn, market products or services to consumers.



#### **B. Purchasing Behavior**

#### There are 4 categories based on purchasing behavior: **Convenience Products**, **Shopping Products**, **Speciality Products**, and **Unsought Products**


 **1. Convenience Products:**
   - Definition: A convenience product is an inexpensive product that requires a minimum amount of effort on the part of the consumer in order to select and purchase it. These are everyday, low-cost items that consumers buy frequently with minimal effort. They are usually readily available, and consumers do not spend much time comparing brands or evaluating options.
   - Example: Snacks, toiletries, newspapers, etc.

 **2. Shopping Products:**
   - Definition: Shopping products are products that are purchased less frequently than convenience products but more frequently than specialty products. Shopping products are more expensive items that consumers purchase less frequently. Consumers typically engage in a more extended decision-making process, comparing features, prices, and quality before making a purchase.
   - Example: Clothing, appliances, electronics, etc.

 **3. Specialty Products:**
   - Definition: A specialty product is a product that certain consumers will actively seek to purchase because of unique characteristics ot loyalty to a specific brand. Consumers who seek specialty products know what they want and will spend the time and effort to get it. Specialty products are unique or high-end items that consumers are willing to make a special effort to obtain. These products often have specific features or characteristics that differentiate them from other products in the market.
   - Example: Luxury cars, designer clothing, high-end watches, etc.

 **4. Unsought Products:**
   - Definition: Products that have little or no proactive customer demand are called unsought products. Because customers do not perceive a need for these products, the offer and its benefits must be directly promoted to potential customers to generate interest. New technology products focus on innovators and early adopters to gain momentum and influence others. Unsought products are items that consumers may not actively seek to purchase or may not even be aware of. Marketing efforts are often needed to make consumers aware of these products and their benefits.
   - Example: Life insurance, burial plots, fire extinguishers, etc.



   #### **C. By Industry**

   #### There are 2 categories based on by Industy: **Vertical Market Products** and **Horizontal Market Products**

  **1. Vertical Market Products**

   -  A vertical market product is a single type of product that is sold through one specific channel at a time. Products that are tailored to meet the needs of specific industry are called vertical market products. For Example, Healthcare Industry - PharmEasy, Financial Services - HDFC bank App, etc.

   - Vertical market products are designed and developed for a specific industry or niche. These products cater to the unique needs and requirements of a particular vertical market or business sector. They often have specialized features that make them well-suited for a specific industry's challenges.

   - Example: Accounting
   software tailored specifically for the healthcare industry, point-of-sale systems for restaurants, or project management software designed for the construction sector.

  **2. Horizontal Market Products**

   -  A product that is sold across multiple channels but within a single industry or category. When a product is present in multiple industries, it is described as a horizontal market product. For Example, Accounting Software - quickbooks, etc.

   -  Horizontal market products are designed to meet the needs of a broad range of industries or business sectors. These products are versatile and can be applied across different verticals. They usually have general features that appeal to a wide audience rather than being specialized for a particular industry.

   -  Example: Office  productivity software like Microsoft Office, customer relationship management (CRM) software, or general-purpose project management tools that can be used across various industries.
